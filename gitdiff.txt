 \section{Introduction}

+tax collection strategies. While the administrative issue for the
 property tax is simple: Did the taxpayer pay the tax on time or not?
 If not, then what can the tax administrator do to enforce compliance?
-Nevertheless, there is considerable disagreement on how to ensure 
-compliance for property taxes. 
-
-The most common strategy to enforce compliance is the economic stick -
-fines and penalties.  Failure to pay property taxes in time leads to
-interest penalties sufficiently large that there is no arbitrage
-advantage to waiting, and perhaps to a significant late fine as well.
-But fines only work if taxpayers believe they will be enforced.  Large
-fines may be seen by taxpayers as a signal of a desperate and
-ineffective tax collector, as politically inviable and thus as empty
-threats, or in the extreme, as a breakdown of cooperative democratic
-governance.
-
-When a delinquent tax payers does not respond to penalties and fines  the city can take out a tax lien
-on the property.  After a tax lien has been obtained, it can also
-start foreclosure process.  A tax lien is a lien imposed by law upon a
-property to secure the payment of taxes.  Before the owner can sell
-the property and give clear title to the buyer, he must pay off the
-lien. However, a lien does not impose a direct cost on a delinquent
-tax payer and thus may only provide weak incentives to comply with the
-tax laws. Moreover, liens are ineffective tools to collect tax debt if
-the property is not transacted in the market. If, for example, the
-transaction occurs within a family, it may not require an official
-transfer of the deed.
-
-A city can sell tax liens to investors.\footnote{In July 2015 the City
-  of Philadelphia tried to auction off 865 liens online. The results
-  were disappointing. The city sold only sold 28 percent of the liens
-  for a total of \$2.1 million, according to data from the city's
-  revenue department. (Philadelphia Magazine, 2015). One potential
-  problem of this sale was that the minimum bid for the liens might
-  have been priced too high.} Properties often sell for a premium at
-lien auctions. This means that the lien holder gets zero percent
-interest and actually pays a premium to acquire the lien with the hope
-of foreclosing and obtaining clear title to the property. However,
-selling liens to ``vulture investors" can be costly from a political
-perspective.
-
-Lien holders can start the foreclosure process if they do not recover
-the taxes in due time. When the owner of a property located in a city
-fails to make a payment arrangement on municipal debt levied on
-his/her property, that property may be sold at the Tax Sheriff Sale to
-allow the city to collect on that unpaid debt. However, the
-foreclosure process is costly and time intensive. In Philadelphia, the
-process of offloading a property at a sheriff's sale can take nine
-months to a year. Given that the median outstanding tax debt in
-Philadelphia in a single year is typically less than \$1000, sheriff
-sales may not be cost effective for a variety of properties with low
-and median market values.
-
-Given the inherent problems associated with standard enforcement
-strategies attention has turned to low cost alternatives. The main
-option for cities is to develop more effective notification
-strategies.  In this paper we explore the efficacy of seven ``nudges"
-for improved property tax collection in one major U.S. city,
-Philadelphia.\footnote{For a survey on field experiments see \citeA{Harrison-List-04}.}
- Our first nudge strategy is a simple reminder letter to
-the taxpayer that their taxes are due; the letter is identical in
-content to the initial tax bill listing the tax due and any penalties
-for late payments.  The reminder letter will be our ``control nudge"

 We have designed and implemented a new, multi-arm, field experiment
 designed to test which low-cost notification strategies increase
-property tax payment rates. Our results suggest that notification
-strategies are effective at reducing tax delinquency and increasing
-tax revenue collection.  Our different treatments are motivated by a
-wide swath of theorized ``nudges" including social norming, moral
-suasion, tax morale, and deterrence. Our results suggest that all
-treatments are successful in increasing tax compliance and raising
-revenue for the city in the short run. Hence, a revenue director can

-while 645 paid their 2015 taxes. The city reaped \$5.5 million in
-cash, as well as an additional \$2.2 million in expected payment
-agreements. All together, that's about \$10 million in proceeds. In
-other words, it appears that a lien sale is an incredibly effective
-tool with which to threaten property owners who have not paid their
-taxes." After we concluded this experiment, we debriefed the city
-about our results. The city then decided to send a version of our
-sheriff sale letter to all late tax payers in the summer of
-2016. While we do not have the data to assess the effectiveness of
-this full scale implementation of our notification strategy, early
-results seem to indicate that these letters improved tax compliance
-within the City of Philadelphia.

+Our results clearly suggest that many tax delinquents are seemingly unaware of the
+consequences of nonpayment. Our provision of detailed information
+about the collection process had a clear impact on the likelihood of
+repayment. This result echoes other recent findings that clear,
+consistent, and timely provision of information on consequences,
+particularly in the context of compliance monitoring, can lead to
+notable improvements in behavioral compliance \citeA{hawken}. Perhaps,
+then, the puzzle of high non-payment rates can be understood as a case
+of under-enforcement. This possibility is reinforced by the fact that
+conditional on any payment, converted defiers became near perfect
+compliers, making full payments in almost all cases. This suggests
+that at least for the margin affected, liquidity-constraints are not
+the primary reason for initial non-payment.
